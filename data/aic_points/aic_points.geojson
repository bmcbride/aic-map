Depending on the season and the time of day, you may be able to hear birds singing. Listen to the audio file for an example of the “dawn chorus”; the cacophony of bird sounds that begins as early as 4:00 A.M. and can last for several hours. Birds tend to sing most often in the breeding season (~ June in the Adirondacks) and most species sing more frequently in the early morning.  Different species join the chorus at different times throughout the day. Later in the summer, when male birds are not trying to attract mates or defend territories, vocalizations will decrease. By September, many of our migratory songbirds are returning to their southern homes and year-round residents like the black-capped chickadee, the golden-crowned kinglet and the blue jay are the species most commonly heard in the forest. Do you hear any birds today? What time is it? What season? What is the weather like? All these factors can influence the composition of the birds that are singing and the quantity and quality of their song.", "photo_marquee": null, "photo_other": null, "audio": "d65b6ffe-ea59-45c3-8e89-bb08df759cf4" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -74.191324, 43.975874 ] } },

Slow growth continued under low light conditions over the first  80 years of life; during this time the tree grew to only about 3 inches in diameter!  Wider growth rings starting around 1940 indicate that a disturbance, most likely logging or blow down, removed the forest overstory and allowed direct sunlight to reach the tree.  With access to light no longer limiting growth, this tree was able to nearly triple it's former growth rate.   Hemlocks can live up to 800 years and this tree has now achieved coveted 'canopy status',  where it will likely remain for centuries to come.

During the runoff, the log drive could commence and the dam at the outlet would be open to flush the logs down stream, beginning their one or two year trip to the sawmills and paper mills in the Glens Falls area.
